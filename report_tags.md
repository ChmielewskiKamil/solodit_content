| 51% Attack | An attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by a group of miners who control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate. Owning 51% of the nodes on the network gives the controlling parties the power to alter the blockchain. |
| Aave | Aave is a decentralized cryptocurrency platform that allows users to borrow and lend crypto. Aave uses smart contracts to automate the process, with preset rules on how funds are distributed, how collateral is handled, and how fees are assessed. |

| DAO | A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an emerging form of legal structure that has no central governing body and whose members share a common goal to act in the best interest of the entity. Popularized through cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain technology, DAOs are used to make decisions in a bottom-up management approach. |

| Grief Attack | A gas griefing attack happens when a user sends the amount of gas required to execute the target smart contract, but not its sub calls. In most cases, this results in uncontrolled behavior that could have a dangerous impact on the business logic. |
